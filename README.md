# LangGraph-Local-Explorations

This repository is dedicated to exploring the capabilities of LangGraph, with a particular focus on using local models (specifically llama3.1 8b). It serves as a playground for experimenting with various LangGraph features and use cases.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to follow and adapt the LangGraph documentation tutorials, implementing them with local models. This allows for a deeper understanding of LangGraph's functionalities without relying on cloud-based language models.

## Current Progress

So far, we have explored the basics of LangGraph through the Quick Start tutorial. The repository contains scripts that demonstrate:

1. A basic chatbot implementation
2. Integration of tools (like web search) into the chatbot
3. Implementation of memory and state management
4. Human-in-the-loop functionality

## Planned Explorations

Following the structure of the LangGraph documentation, we aim to explore:

### Chatbots
- Customer Support
- Prompt Generation from User Requirements
- Code Assistant

### Multi-Agent Systems
- Collaboration
- Supervision
- Hierarchical Teams

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Adaptive RAG
- Agentic RAG
- Corrective RAG
- Self-RAG
- SQL Agent

### Planning Agents
- Plan-and-Execute
- Reasoning without Observation
- LLMCompiler

### Reflection & Critique
- Basic Reflection
- Reflexion
- Language Agent Tree Search
- Self-Discover Agent

### Evaluation
- Agent-based
- In LangSmith

### Experimental
- Web Research (STORM)
- TNT-LLM
- Web Navigation
- Competitive Programming
- Complex data extraction

## Getting Started

To run the scripts in this repository, you'll need to have LangGraph installed and access to a local instance of llama3.1 8b. Detailed setup instructions will be added in the future.

## Contribution

This is an experimental repository, and contributions or suggestions for new explorations are welcome. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have ideas for improving or expanding the experiments.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational and experimental purposes. The implementations here may not be production-ready and are primarily meant for learning and exploring LangGraph's capabilities with local models.
